# basic-html
This is one of the first HTML pages I have written. It is pure HTML with NO styling on the page. It contains a few different examples of HTML syntax, including:
- Heading tags
- Lists - ordered and unordered
- Table
- Anchor tags - links to other pages
- Iframe - You tube link 
- Image
- In-line styling (OK so there was a little styling)
- Submit button for FORM action (link to another page)
